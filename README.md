## üõ†Ô∏è Current Progress

### ‚úîÔ∏è Mesh Rendering Engine
- Fully implemented and operational.
- Provides accurate and efficient rendering of 3D meshes.
- Currently using a basic Physically Based Renderering shader
- Really need to add an orthographic view and a button to change between ortho and perspective

### üñ•Ô∏è CPU-only Slicer

- **Status:** Working
- Able to slice most objects correctly. 
- Generates image data that will be usable by a future g-code/printer file creator and ctb sdk
- Has some bugs where some polygons in a slice are not rendered properly -- weird issues affecting <1% of slice images
- Fully multithreaded, will use 100% of each core currently

### üõ†Ô∏è Printer Settings Module

- **Status:** Basic Functionality Implemented.
  - Load printer settings from `.toml` files for easy configuration, customization, and sharing.
- **Planned Functionality:**
  - GUI for creating and editing printer profiles
  - Some way to actually select a printer, it is currently hardcoded

  ### ü´±üèø‚Äçü´≤üèª User Settings Module

- **Status:** Basic Functionality Implemented.
  - Load user settings from `.toml` files for easy configuration, customization, and sharing.
- **Planned Functionality:**
  - GUI for creating and editing profiles
  - Some way to actually select a profile, it is currently hardcoded

### üñ•Ô∏è Highly Responsive UI

- **Status:** Implemented.
- Slicing is currently blocking the UI while saving the debug images to the drive. :shrug:

### üîÑ Multithreading

- **Status:** Looking Good.
- Actively working on leveraging multithreading to enhance performance wherever beneficial.
- CPU Slicer is able to utilize all cpu resources. It's actually a bit of a hog but really fast. Might need to configure niceness/priority somehow

## üöÄ Upcoming Features

### üìù G-code/3D Printer File Generator

- **Status:** Not started.
- **Planned Functionality:**
  - Generate G-code files compatible with MSLA resin printers

### üñºÔ∏è G-code/Slice Images Viewer

- **Status:** Not started.
- **Planned Functionality:**
  - Visualize G-code and slice images within the application for better inspection and verification before printing.

### üéõÔ∏è GPU Compute Slicer

- **Status:** Not working
- Needs to be updated to be in line with the way the CPU slicer works. Now that the CPU slicer is mostly working this might come soon

### üñß Network Printing

- **Status:** Not started.
- **Planned Functionality:**
  - Send files for printing directly to printers over the network.
  - This might actually not be possible with the current Chitubox SDK.

## üìä Test Coverage

Trying to ensure robust and reliable functionality through comprehensive testing. Currently focusing on components not involving OpenGL.

- **Total Coverage:** **36.19%** 485/1340 lines covered

## üåü Goals

SealSlicer aims to provide a comprehensive and efficient slicing solution for MSLA resin printers with the following objectives:

- **Mesh Rendering Engine:** Accurate and efficient rendering of 3D meshes.
- **CPU-only Slicer:** Normal slicing functionality using CPU resources.
- **GPU Compute Slicer:** Enhanced slicing performance leveraging GPU acceleration.
- **Printer Settings Module:** Easy configuration through `.toml` files.
- **G-code/3D Printer File Generator:** Direct generation of printer-compatible files.
- **G-code/Slice Images Viewer:** Visual inspection of slicing results.
- **High Responsiveness:** Ensuring the UI remains responsive during intensive operations.
- **Multithreading:** Utilizing multiple threads to optimize performance.

## üìù Notes

- **GPU Slicing:** The GPU slicing component is broken currently
- **Responsive UI:** While the UI is currently responsive, slicing operations block the UI thread. Fixes are planned to resolve this.
- **Test Coverage:** Focused on ensuring reliability for non-OpenGL components, with ongoing efforts to increase coverage.
- **Future Enhancements:** Plans include expanding compatibility, and adding user-friendly features like settings management and file visualization.
